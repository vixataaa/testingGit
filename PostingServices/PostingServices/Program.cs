            // - every time the program is started orders to check if they are later than DateTime.Now and mark themselves received
            // - track : enter the order ID, OrdersContainer searches in its list for the ID and displays information
            // - not sure how to add events
            // - interfaces for different classes which might contain the methods
            //
            // * can add a few more types of shipments in order to get the required number of classes/depth of inheritance
